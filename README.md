# 🍳 Odin Recipes

A clean, visually engaging recipe website built as my first project for **The Odin Project Foundations**. While the focus was on core web structure, I took it a step further with custom CSS to create a modern, polished user experience.

## 🚀 Features
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Organized structure with a main homepage linking to specific recipe pages.
* **Custom Styling:** Beyond basic HTML, I implemented a custom color palette and typography for a "sick" aesthetic.
* **Responsive Layout:** Basic responsiveness to ensure recipes are readable across different screen sizes.
* **Optimized Assets:** High-quality imagery used for each recipe.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Focused on semantic structure and proper linking.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling including Flexbox for alignment, hover effects, and Google Fonts integration.
* **Git/GitHub:** Managed version control throughout the build process.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project was my introduction to the world of web development. Key takeaways included:
* **The "Box Model":** Truly understanding how padding, margins, and borders interact to create layouts.
* **File Management:** Organizing relative paths for multiple HTML documents and images.
* **CSS Polish:** I learned how much a little bit of CSS (like transition effects and box-shadows) can elevate a simple project
